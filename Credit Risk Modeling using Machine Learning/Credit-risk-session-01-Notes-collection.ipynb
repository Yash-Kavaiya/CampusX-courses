    "\n",
    "1. **DPD (Days Past Due):**\n",
    "   - **Definition:** DPD refers to the number of days a borrower has exceeded the due date for a loan payment.\n",
    "   - **Example:** If a borrower's monthly loan payment is due on the 1st of each month and they miss the payment, they enter DPD status. For instance, if the current date is the 15th and the borrower hasn't made the payment, they are 15 days past due.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Non-performing Asset (NPA):**\n",
    "   - **Definition:** A loan becomes an NPA if the borrower misses payments for a specific period, often 90 days or more.\n",
    "   - **Example:** If a borrower hasn't made any payments for 90 days on a loan, it is classified as an NPA.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Special Mention Account (SMA):**\n",
    "   - **Definition:** SMA refers to loans identified by banks as having a high potential of turning into NPAs.\n",
    "   - **Example:** A loan with consistent delays in payments or signs of financial stress from the borrower may be categorized as SMA.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Write-off:**\n",
    "   - **Definition:** A loan is written off when the bank deems it unrecoverable and removes it from active accounts.\n",
    "   - **Example:** If all attempts to recover a loan fail, such as through legal actions or negotiations, the bank may decide to write off the loan as a loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding these stages helps banks manage risks associated with loans and take appropriate actions to recover funds or minimize losses."

    "| **Impact on Regression Analysis** | Makes it difficult to interpret the coefficients of individual variables. Increases the variance of the estimated coefficients, making them less precise and potentially leading to unreliable results. | Does not directly affect the validity of the regression model, but can affect the precision of coefficient estimates. High correlation can make it difficult to determine the individual contribution of each variable to the model. |\n",
    "| **Detection Methods** |  - Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)  - Eigenvalues of the correlation matrix  - Examining the condition number | Correlation coefficient |\n",
    "| **Consequences** |  - Coefficients with high standard errors  - Coefficients with unexpected signs  - Difficulty isolating the effects of individual variables |  - Reduced precision of coefficient estimates  - Potential for misleading interpretations |\n",
    "| **Remedies** |  - Dropping a collinear variable (carefully chosen to minimize information loss)  - Combining collinear variables  - Using regularization techniques (e.g., ridge regression, LASSO) |  - Depending on the severity, may not require specific action. If problematic, consider dropping a highly correlated variable or transforming the data. |\n",

    "* **What it is:**  A statistical measure of the linear relationship between two variables. It tells you the strength and direction of the association.\n",
    "* **Values:** Ranges from -1 (perfect negative correlation) to +1 (perfect positive correlation), with 0 indicating no correlation.\n",
    "* **Example:** Height and weight are often positively correlated. Taller people tend to weigh more.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Multicollinearity**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **What it is:** Occurs in multiple regression when two or more independent variables (predictors) are highly correlated with each other.  This means the predictors can, to some extent, be used to predict each other.\n",
    "* **Problem:** Multicollinearity makes it hard to determine the *individual* effect of each predictor on the outcome variable. This leads to:\n",
    "    * **Unstable coefficients:** Estimates of how much the outcome variable changes per unit change in a predictor can fluctuate wildly with small data changes.\n",
    "    * **Inflated standard errors:** It becomes more difficult to determine if a predictor's effect is statistically significant.\n",
    "    * **Overfitting** Models might perform well on training data but have poor real-world prediction capability.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Correlation Can Be Misleading with Multicollinearity**\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple correlation between two variables might be low, but  that doesn't rule out multicollinearity. A group of other predictors, when combined, might strongly predict one of the variables you thought were uncorrelated.  This is more difficult to see just by looking at pairs of correlations.\n",

    "Certainly! VIF, or Variance Inflation Factor, is a diagnostic tool used in regression analysis to quantify the severity of multicollinearity. \n",
    "\n",
    "**What does VIF measure?**\n",
    "\n",
    "VIF measures how much the variance of an estimated regression coefficient is inflated due to multicollinearity. In simpler terms, it tells you how much more uncertain the coefficient for a particular variable is because other variables in the model are already capturing some of its effect. \n",

    "\n",
    "**Interpreting VIF values:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* A VIF of 1 indicates no multicollinearity, and the coefficient's variance is not inflated.\n",
    "* A VIF greater than 1 suggests some degree of multicollinearity. The higher the VIF, the greater the inflation of the variance and the less precise the coefficient estimate.\n",
    "* There's no single threshold for a \"high\" VIF.  Common rules of thumb suggest:\n",
    "    * VIF > 5 indicates moderate multicollinearity.\n",
    "    * VIF > 10 indicates severe multicollinearity, and the coefficient estimates might be unreliable.\n",

    "**Important points about VIF:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* VIF is just a guide, and other factors can influence the impact of multicollinearity.\n",
    "* A high VIF for one variable doesn't necessarily mean there's a problem for other variables in the model. \n",
    "* VIF should be used alongside other diagnostics to assess multicollinearity.\n",

    "**What to do if you find high VIF?**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you find high VIF for some variables, here are some approaches you can consider:\n",

    "* **Combine variables:** If variables have a natural interpretation together, you could create a new combined variable.\n",
    "* **Dimensionality reduction techniques:** Techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) can help reduce the number of variables while retaining most of the information.\n",
    "* **Regularization:** Techniques like Ridge Regression can help shrink coefficient estimates and reduce the impact of multicollinearity.\n",
